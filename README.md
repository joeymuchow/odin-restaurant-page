# odin-restaurant-page

This is a project from The Odin Project's javascript course where we are creating a restaurant's webpage using webpack. It is a very different approach compared to our previous projects for project setup. I also learned I shouldn't choose colors, I apologize to anyone who looks at this, but I don't feel like changing anything. I'm just practicing webpack.
